## Data Flow

1. **User Request Flow**:
   - User requests weather data for a location
   - Request authenticated based on user tier
   - Data retrieved from cache if available
   - If not cached, request sent to prediction system
   - Results returned to user and cached for future requests

2. **Device Contribution Flow**:
   - Device registers with the system
   - System assigns computational tasks based on device capabilities
   - Device processes tasks and returns results
   - System aggregates results from multiple devices
   - Contribution metrics updated and displayed to user

3. **API Consumption Flow**:
   - External system authenticates with API
   - Rate limits and access controls applied based on tier
   - Data formatted according to API specifications
   - Usage metrics tracked for billing/quotas

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances as user base grows
- **Regional Deployment**: Deploy in multiple geographic regions
- **Load Distribution**: Intelligent routing based on server load
- **Database Sharding**: Partition data by geographic region
- **Microservices**: Break down into independently scalable components

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for sensitive tiers
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with least privilege
- **Data Encryption**: TLS for transport, encryption at rest for sensitive data
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, token validation, request signing
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security events
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

## Monitoring and Analytics
