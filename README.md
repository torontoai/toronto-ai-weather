# Toronto AI Weather

A cutting-edge weather prediction platform that leverages multiple data sources, advanced machine learning models, and distributed computation to deliver hyper-accurate, real-time weather forecasts.

## Project Overview

Toronto AI Weather is an innovative weather prediction system designed to serve multiple user groups with tailored features and access levels. The system integrates data from 100+ diverse sources, employs advanced machine learning techniques, and utilizes a tiered distributed computation model to provide accurate and timely weather forecasts.

## System Architecture

The system is structured into five key layers:

1. **Data Layer**: Manages ingestion, processing, and storage of data from 100+ diverse sources
2. **Computation Layer**: Handles distributed task management and machine learning operations
3. **Application Layer**: Provides backend APIs and frontend interfaces for user interaction
4. **Security Layer**: Ensures secure access, data protection, and user authentication
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: Supports scalability, performance optimizations, and system reliability

## Key Features

### Multi-Tiered User Access

- **Civilian**: Basic weather predictions and gamification for engagement
- **Enterprise**: API access to predictions, advanced analytics, hyperlocal forecasts
- **Military**: Anomaly detection (ion, vorticity, seismic data), severe weather alerts

### Advanced Machine Learning Models

- **Hybrid CNN-LSTM Models**: For spatial-temporal forecasting
- **Quantum-inspired Models**: For complex weather pattern prediction
- **Federated Learning**: For distributed model training
- **Anomaly Detection**: For identifying unusual weather patterns

### Data Integration

- Integration of 100+ diverse data sources, including:
  - Weather stations (NOAA, ECCC)
  - Satellite data
  - IoT devices
  - Social media (for sentiment analysis)
  - Seismic data
  - Cosmic ray flux
  - Ion data
  - Vorticity measurements
  - Farmers' Almanac predictions

### Distributed Computation

- Tiered model based on user type:
  - Military: Highest priority, handles resource-intensive tasks
  - Enterprise: Medium priority, manages advanced computations
  - Civilian: Lowest priority, contributes to basic tasks

### Security Features

- JWT-based authentication with group-specific claims
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for military users

### Unique Capabilities

- **Military-grade Anomaly Detection**: Using specialized data to detect weather anomalies
- **Weather Sentiment Index (WSI)**: Analyzing social media sentiment to predict human behavior during weather events
- **Expert Feedback Integration**: Automated collection and processing of meteorologist feedback
